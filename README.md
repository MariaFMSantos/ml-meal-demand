This repository provides the computational implementation and source code developed for the research article titled "Evaluating the Effectiveness and Impact of Machine Learning Models for Forecasting Meal Demand in University Restaurants". The study focuses on the application of advanced predictive modeling to optimize operational efficiency and resource allocation within institutional dining facilities.

The core of this research involves the implementation of three distinct machine learning architectures: Decision Trees, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. These models were developed using Python and the scikit-learn library to ensure a robust and standardized analytical framework. The code included here demonstrates the preprocessing pipelines, hyperparameter configurations, and evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of each model in a real-world engineering context.

Regarding data transparency, please note that the files provided in this repository consist of representative subsets of the original data. Due to institutional privacy restrictions and data protection agreements concerning university restaurant operations, the full dataset cannot be publicly shared. These samples are provided exclusively for research and reproducibility purposes, allowing for the inspection of the methodology and algorithmic logic described in the paper.
